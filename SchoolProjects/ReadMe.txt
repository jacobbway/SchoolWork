Hello,

Welcome to my github repo for projects I have enjoyed creating or enjoyed solving a certain problem or am proud of in general.

My Website isn't hosted anywhere I suppose I could get it hosted on GitHub like my portfolio 
(check that out here https://jacobbway.github.io/my-portfolio/ )
It also isn't very good to be honest but I really enjoyed making it due to the creative freedom it allowed me and 
all the research I had to accomplish to get it to work the way I wanted.

The other three Projects are C++, I am working on getting some of my JAVA projects off of my laptop to upload to here as well.
However nothing we did in that class was very impressive, just a good demonstration of the basics.

Thanks for reading,
Jacob
